  <p>All of a sudden cat goes crazy purr while eating all of a sudden cat goes crazy, but pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms, meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Knock over christmas tree. Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day flop over sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened.</p>
